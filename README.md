DevHub is a dynamic web application designed to connect and showcase developers' work, created for the Appwrite X Hashnode Hackathon.

## Tech Stack

   - Frontend: React JS
   - Backend: Node.js
   - Appwrite Cloud Services: Database, Authentication, Functions, Storage

## Why Appwrite

Appwrite provided the perfect backend tech stack for DevHub, offering user-friendly authentication, fast database management, and efficient storage and function services.

## How I Used Appwrite

I utilized Appwrite's database service to store user information, devits, hackathons, and blogs. The authentication feature enabled social media logins. Appwrite Functions were used to crawl blogs and hackathons. Storage service stored images from devits.

## Challenges Faced

Designing the theme, querying documents, handling arrays of objects, and resolving authentication issues during hosting were some challenges faced. The Appwrite community and mentors provided valuable support.
